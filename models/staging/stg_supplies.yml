      List of our supply expenses data with basic cleaning and transformation
      applied.

      One row per supply cost, not per supply. As supply costs fluctuate they
      receive a new row with a new UUID. Thus there can be multiple rows per
      supply_id.
    columns:
      - name: supply_uuid
        description: The unique key of our supplies per cost.
